To get better data, I could process the data like so:

Calculated Metrics
- Regional market share percentages
- Product mix percentages per region
- Satisfaction vs. sales correlation coefficient
- Growth rates (if you have historical comparison)
- Average order value by segment

Enriched Time Series
- Weekly/monthly aggregations (not just daily)
- Moving averages (7-day, 30-day)
- Year-over-year comparisons if you have 2+ years
- Day-of-week patterns

Performance Rankings
- Top/bottom performers clearly flagged
- Deviation from average (±%)
- Quartile rankings for products/regions

Satisfaction Insights
- Satisfaction score distribution (not just averages)
- % of customers in each satisfaction tier (1-2, 3, 4-5 stars)
- Correlation matrix: satisfaction × sales by segment
